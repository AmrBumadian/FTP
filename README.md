This was a project/task in Computer Networking course at college. It is not much and not perfect, but this project is what made me learn Java,
and I managed to finish it in time after a coding-learning streak of about 11 hours.

### Topics Learnt

* Core Java
* Java File system
* Java Collections
* Threading
* Networking and Socket Programming
* Exception Handling
* DataStreams, I/O Streams and buffers
